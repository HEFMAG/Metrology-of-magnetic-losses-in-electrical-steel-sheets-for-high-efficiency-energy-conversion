Example of theoretical computation of complex permeability, specific loss, and eddy current loss component in the nanocrystalline ribbon Vacuumschmelze VITROPERM 500F.

To check the tool, run the Matlab script TheoreticalLoss. It uses the functions Lossinribbon and the data saved in mu_vitroperm_500.mat that can be retrieved from
